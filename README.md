# C++ To-Do List Manager

## Overview

As a software engineer eager to expand my understanding of foundational programming languages, I created this simple To-Do List Manager using C++. This project allowed me to explore core C++ syntax and concepts such as classes, file handling, and the Standard Template Library (STL). My goal was to gain hands-on experience working with low-level constructs and memory-safe practices, which are crucial in systems and performance-critical programming.

The To-Do List Manager is a console application that allows users to create, view, update, and persist a list of tasks. It demonstrates essential C++ programming techniques and serves as a building block for more advanced applications involving file I/O and data structures.
